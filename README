ActsAsGenetree
==============

   a) A hierarchical object is an object which has a parent hierarchical object.
      Hence, there can be a tree of hierarchical objects.

   b) Given a tree of hierarchical objects, each object can answer the following questions:
      1) What is the subtree rooted under this hierarchical object?
      2) What is the ordered list of ancestor objects for this hierarchical object?
      3) What are the sibiling hierarchical objects of this hierarchical object?
      4) What is the depth of this hierarchical objects in its tree?

   c) An implementation of a tree data structure using a relational database would have to address
      two issues related to each object:
      1) The object's identification
      2) The object's position in the tree

      In the current implementation:
      1) The primary key field is used to unquiely identify the object.
      2) The sortkey field stores the "genelogical order" of an object, as described in Miguel Sofer's paper.
      3) The sortkey is not derived from the object's primary key identifier (unlike as described in
         Sofer's paper).
      4) The sortkey is a base159 encoded string. Lexical ordering of sortkeys forms the basis for
         representing the tree. Tree operations can be performed using lexical comparsions or substring
         operations on the sortkey.


Example
=======

      1) Creating a root object:

      root = HierarchicalObject.new
      root.id = 1999
      saved_p = root.save

      2) Creating a child object:

      node2 = HierarchicalObject.new
      node2.id = 2876
      node2.parent_id = 1999
      node2.save

      node3 = HierarchicalObject.new
      node3.id = 2877
      node3.parent_id = 1999
      node3.save

      Upon execution of above, we would have the following rows:

      mysql> select * from hierarchical_objects order by sortkey;
      +------+-----------+--------------+
      | id   | parent_id | sortkey      |
      +------+-----------+--------------+
      | 1999 |      NULL | /00          | 
      | 2876 |      1999 | /00/00       | 
      | 2877 |      1999 | /00/01       | 
      +------+-----------+--------------+

      Notice, how the sortkey holds both the depth and the ordering of a record.

      3) To delete a (sub)tree we can do the following:

      HierarchicalObject.find( 1999 ).subtree.reverse.each {
        |obj|
        obj.destroy
      }

      4) We can also iterate through the ordered list of ancestors:

      HierarchicalObject.find( 21 ).ancestors.each {
        |obj|
        .....
      }
